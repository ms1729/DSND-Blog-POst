## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run with no issues using following libraries:

- nltk 3.3.0
- numpy 1.15.2
- pandas 0.23.4
- scikit-learn 0.20.0
- sqlalchemy 1.2.12


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2020 to better understand:

From some of the questions that were asked in the 2020 survey, I would like to get a better understaning of the following questions:

1. Which programming, scripting, and markup languages have the developers used in thir work over the past year?
2. Does the company onboarding process have any link to job satisfaction of the developers?
3. Based on the age of the developer, do they have any preference to the collaboration tool they use?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://mohitsharma13.medium.com/trends-of-developer-community-a-view-using-data-science-approach-on-stack-overflow-data-6fe634d3156c).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
